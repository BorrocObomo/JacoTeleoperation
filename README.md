# JacoTeleoperation
Real-Time Dynamic Interace for Human-Machine Interaction

To build and run it yourself you will need a LeapMotion sensor and a Kinova Jaco2 arm. You should also have their respective SDKs installed on your Windows computer. 

Having any Kinova SDKs open before running this program will cause the robot to not respond. Make sure to close them before launching.

If the robot stops moving or behaves erratically, you can reset it by sending it to the home position manually using the physical controller.
